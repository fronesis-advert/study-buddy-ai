# Production Hardening Summary

## ✅ Completed Security & Reliability Improvements

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization** 🔐
**Priority: CRITICAL**

- ✅ Implemented Supabase Auth in `lib/auth.ts`
- ✅ `getCurrentUserId()` now returns real user IDs from session cookies
- ✅ All API endpoints now check user authentication
- ✅ Installed `@supabase/ssr` for server-side auth

**Impact:** Users' data is now properly isolated. No more global guest context.

---

### 2. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies** 🛡️
**Priority: CRITICAL**

Created migration `0002_enable_rls_policies.sql` with:
- ✅ Enabled RLS on all tables (documents, chunks, sessions, messages, quizzes)
- ✅ Users can only view/modify their own documents
- ✅ Chunks are accessible only through owned documents
- ✅ Sessions and messages are user-scoped
- ✅ Service role bypass for system operations

**Impact:** Database-level protection. Even if app logic fails, data remains isolated.

---

### 3. **API Endpoint Hardening** 🔒
**Priority: HIGH**

**Documents API (`app/api/documents/route.ts`):**
- ✅ DELETE endpoint checks document ownership before deletion (403 if unauthorized)
- ✅ GET endpoint filters by user_id (shows only user's documents)
- ✅ Added proper 404/403 error responses

**Impact:** Prevents unauthorized deletion and data leakage.

---

### 4. **File Upload Validation** 📁
**Priority: HIGH**

**Ingest API (`app/api/ingest/route.ts`):**
- ✅ 10MB file size limit (returns 413 if exceeded)
- ✅ MIME type whitelist: PDF, TXT, MD, CSV, JSON
- ✅ Validates MIME before processing (returns 415 for unsupported types)

**Impact:** Prevents memory exhaustion and invalid file attacks.

---

### 5. **Rate Limiting with Redis** 🚦
**Priority: HIGH**

**Rate Limit Library (`lib/rate-limit.ts`):**
- ✅ Integrated Upstash Redis for distributed rate limiting
- ✅ Automatic fallback to in-memory (with warning) if Redis unavailable
- ✅ Graceful error handling with fallback
- ✅ Sliding window implementation

**Setup Required:**
```bash
# Get free Redis at https://upstash.com
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_url_here
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

**Impact:** Multi-instance/serverless safe. No more rate limit bypasses on cold starts.

---

### 6. **Embedding Error Handling** 🔄
**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Embed Library (`lib/rag/embed.ts`):**
- ✅ Validates OpenAI returns embeddings for ALL inputs
- ✅ Checks for empty/undefined embeddings
- ✅ 3-retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- ✅ Detailed error logging

**Impact:** No more corrupted vector data in the database.

---

### 7. **Test Endpoint Removal** 🗑️
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- ✅ Deleted `app/api/test-env/` (exposed environment validity)
- ✅ Deleted `app/api/ingest-test/` (public ingestion test)

**Impact:** No information leakage about your environment.

---

### 8. **TypeScript Improvements** 📘
**Priority: LOW**

- ✅ Kept `as any` casts in AI SDK calls (necessary due to version mismatch)
- ✅ Added proper type annotations to rate limiting
- ✅ Fixed embedding return type to `Promise<number[][]>`

**Impact:** Improved type safety without breaking functionality.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### Before Going Live:

1. **Set up Upstash Redis:**
   - Go to https://upstash.com
   - Create a free Redis database
   - Add credentials to `.env.local`

2. **Configure Supabase Auth:**
   - Enable email/password or OAuth in Supabase dashboard
   - Set up auth redirects for your domain
   - Test sign-up/login flows

3. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Required
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
   
   # Recommended (for production rate limiting)
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://...
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
   ```

4. **Test the hardening:**
   - Try deleting another user's document (should get 403)
   - Upload a 20MB file (should get 413)
   - Upload a .exe file (should get 415)
   - Trigger rate limit by making 61 requests in 60s
