# Flashcard Feature - Testing Checklist

## Pre-Testing Setup

- [ ] Click "Generate Flashcards"
- [ ] Verify 5-15 cards are created
- [ ] Check card quality (relevant Q&A pairs)

## AI Generation from Document
- [ ] Go to "Documents" tab

- [ ] Wait for processing
- [ ] Click Brain icon (ðŸ§ ) next to document
- [ ] Wait for flashcard generation
- [ ] Go to "Flashcards" tab
- [ ] Verify new deck appears with cards

## Study Session
- [ ] Open any deck with cards
- [ ] Click "Study Now"

- [ ] Verify back shows answer
- [ ] Click rating buttons (1-5)
- [ ] Verify next card appears
- [ ] Complete full session
- [ ] Check "All done!" screen appears

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] During study, press Space (should flip)
- [ ] After flip, press 1-5 (should rate and advance)
- [ ] Verify shortcuts work consistently

## Spaced Repetition
- [ ] Review a card and rate it 5 (Perfect)
- [ ] Check database: `flashcard_reviews` has entry
- [ ] Verify `next_review_at` is in future
- [ ] Rate another card 1 (Again)
- [ ] Verify `next_review_at` is ~1 day from now
- [ ] Rate card 3 (Good)
- [ ] Verify `next_review_at` is ~6 days from now

## Due Cards API
- [ ] Visit `/api/flashcards/due` (should show JSON)
- [ ] Check `new_cards` array (never reviewed)
- [ ] Check `due_cards` array (past due date)
- [ ] Check `upcoming_cards` array (future reviews)

## Deck Management
- [ ] Edit deck name (PATCH `/api/flashcards/decks/[deckId]`)
- [ ] Delete a card from deck
- [ ] Delete entire deck
- [ ] Verify cascade deletes work (cards removed)

## UI Components
- [ ] FlashcardList renders all decks
- [ ] Each deck shows stats (total, due, reviewed)
- [ ] Card flip animation is smooth
- [ ] Progress bar updates during study
- [ ] Empty states display properly
- [ ] Mobile responsive (if applicable)

## Integration Points
- [ ] "Flashcards" tab appears in main nav
- [ ] Brain icon appears next to each document
- [ ] Clicking Brain icon generates flashcards
- [ ] Success message appears after generation

## Error Handling
- [ ] Try generating with no OpenAI key (should error gracefully)
- [ ] Try accessing non-existent deck (404)
- [ ] Try reviewing card without auth (401)
- [ ] Try creating deck with empty name (validation error)

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Deck with 0 cards (study button disabled)
- [ ] Deck with 100+ cards (pagination/performance)
- [ ] Very long card text (wraps properly)
- [ ] Cards with special characters
- [ ] Multiple users (RLS isolation)

## Performance
- [ ] AI generation completes in <30s
- [ ] Card flip is instant
- [ ] Deck list loads quickly (<2s)
- [ ] Review flow is smooth (no lag)

## Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## Production Readiness
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (build succeeds)
- [ ] Rate limiting works (if Upstash configured)
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] All API routes have error handling

## Known Issues to Ignore
- âœ… CSS lint warnings for `@tailwind` (Tailwind standard)
- âœ… TypeScript warnings about Supabase types (cosmetic)
- âœ… "onRefresh" serialization warning (client component pattern)

## Success Criteria
âœ… Can create decks manually
âœ… Can generate flashcards from documents
âœ… Can study cards with spaced repetition
âœ… Cards reschedule based on ratings
âœ… Progress tracking works
âœ… UI is smooth and responsive
âœ… No critical errors in console

## If Issues Found
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs in terminal
3. Verify migration applied correctly
4. Check `.env.local` has all required keys
